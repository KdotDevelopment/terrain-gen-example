# terrain-gen-example

I made this project with the following goals:
 - Make a basic 3D engine
 - Make a terrain generator algorithm
 - Learn more about C++
 - Have a good time

Luckily, I managed to meet all these goals. I made this like a minecraft clone and used all of its textures, too.
I am quite proud with how the terrain generation turned out, although it is rather slow.
